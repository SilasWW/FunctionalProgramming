# Functional Programming in F#

This repo is dedicated to a university course on Functional Programming in F#. The course includes a series of assignments, designed to deepen the knowledge with the language and paradigm. These assignments and my answers and solutions, is what these repo will be used for.

## About the course

The subject of the course is functional, declarative programming in general and F# in particular.

This includes the following themes:

### Functional Programming Paradigme:
- first class functions
- higher-order functions
- type inference and polymorphism
- recursion and tail-recursion
- algebraic data types
- strict and lazy evaluation

### Memory Management:
- garbage collection
- reference types
- mutable versus immutable data

### Parallel Programming:
- divide and conquer

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Apply and reflect on theories for modelling, analyzing and constructing functional declarative programs.
- Apply and reflect on the concepts behind functional programming compared to imperative and object oriented programming.
- Construct small and large programs in F# and explain the basic principles behind functional programming using F#.
- Describe and explain solutions to problems in the context of functional programming.
- Apply core concepts of functional programming.
- Reason about the complexity of functional programs.
